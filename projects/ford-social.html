            <h2 class="about__role">Ford Social Community Website</h2>
            <p class="about__desc">
              Shortly after joining Team Detroit (now GTB) in 2015, I was involved in a very ambitious project for our Ford clients. They wanted 
              to boost their online social community to increase brand awareness and loyalty. They had an existing social community site that had 
              gone through a few iterations of technology stacks, but was not performing to their expectations. They wanted to turn their website 
              into a world class social community that their customers would be proud to engage with.
            </p>
            <p class="about__desc">
              The original site was built on WordPress as seen below:
            </p>
            <div class="project__video">
              <div class="project__description">
                <img class="project__image" src="../assets/ford-social-first-iteration.png" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="project__video">
              <div class="project__description">
                <img class="project__image" src="../assets/ford-social-first-iteration-article.png" />
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="about__desc">
              The site was updated in 2013 and was migrated from WordPress to Adobe CQ5. While this iteration provided an upgrade, the agency and 
              Ford clients were still struggling with a way to handle proper, timely moderation of user generated content (UGC) uploaded to the site by 
              end-users. The original process was painstaking and inefficient. They were looking to improve this functionality in order for the site 
              to function effectively as a social community that could support the vast amount of Ford customers and enthusiasts visiting daily.
            </p>
            <div class="project__video">
              <div class="project__description">
                <img class="project__image" src="../assets/ford-social-old-website.png" />

            </div>
            <p class="about__desc">
              So, we set out to redesign the entire site from the ground up on a newer more modern platform that would allow agency moderators to 
              efficiently approve or deny content uploaded by members of the Ford Social community. I worked step-by-step with our development partners 
              at Cognifide (recently merged with <a href="https://www.wundermanthompson.com/poland/" target="_blank" class="link">Wonderman Thompson Technology</a>) 
              to build the site using Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) 6.0 with a MongoDB backend for storing user generated content (UGC), complete with 
              a secure dashboard for agency moderators. Unfortunately, I do not have any screenshots of the dashboard to showcase here, but here are a 
              few images of the redesigned Ford Social home page and an article page that aggregates related content along the bottom of the article.

              We launched the newly redesigned Ford Social site in January of 2017 just in time for the Super Bowl LI. We set up some DNS redirect rules 
              for a couple of Ford domains <i>gofurther.ford.com</i> and <i>ford.com/go-further</i> so that all traffic coming to these domains was 
              rerouted to Ford Social where we had campaign specific messaging. Thanks to working with our partners at 
              <a href="https://www.akamai.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Akamai</a> as well as some solid engineering, we handled the Super Bowl traffic 
              load without incident. Just for nostalgia, here is a link to the the 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxRK2soPYRo" target="_blank" class="link">commercial</a> we used. Enjoy!

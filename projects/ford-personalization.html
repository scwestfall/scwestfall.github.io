            <p class="about__desc">
                Over the past 5 years or so, I managed the technical delivery of solutions focused on personalization and optimization on 
                <a href="https://ford.com" class="link" target="_blank">ford.com</a>. 
            </p>
            <p class="about__desc">
              The Ford website was built on Adobe Experience Manager. The site uses Adobe Tags (formerly Adobe Launch) and Adobe Analytics for data 
              collection. Together with Adobe Target and Adobe Audience Manager, this data ecosystem is used to deliver personalized experiences, 
              product recommendations, journey orchestration, and optimization testing. We worked with our Ford business clients to develop data 
              layer standards and implementation guides for development teams, ensuring the data we wanted to collect or use as a signal to take 
              action against was available on the page when we needed it.

            We collected data points about what our visitors viewed or searched for on ford.com and used Adobe Target to deliver relevant content 
            and messaging on subsequent visits. As you can see in the image above, when a visitor views the home page on their intial visit, 
            they are served "<i>default content</i>" that has been developed for the page. As the visitor navigates around the website looking at vehicle
            pages, vehicle features and other content, we used a mix of Adobe Analytics and cookies to display relevant context-based content to 
            the visitor on subsequent visits. You'll notice on the right side of the image above that the billboard component content has been 
            updated to show a Ford Explorer as opposed to the Ford F-150 shown on the intial visit. 
          </p>
          <p class="about__desc">
            Additonally, there is also a rules-based component that becomes populated with up to the last three vehicles visited by our visitor. This
            personalization has now become the expected experience when vsiting ford.com. Our results showed that our Vehicle Aware experience resulted
            in a 71% increase in our Purchase Intent (PI) score as well as a 17% increase in click-thru-rate (CTR) on our personalized home page 
            billboard content.

          <h3>Regional Targeted Rollout of Features</h3>
          <p class="about__desc">
            Ford clients wanted to test their new eCommerce functionality over a limited geographical area and across only two vehicles, the 2022 Mustang 
            Mach-e and the 2022 Escape. We leveraged Adobe Target to inject the new 3-tabbed Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) component into the home page, 
            vehicle home page and model details pages of the two vehicles for visitors geographically located in New York, New Jersey and Massachussets.
          </p>
          <p class="about__desc">
            This was purely a Journey Orchestration activity with Adobe Analytics implemented throughout the journey for data collection. We also ensured
            that we had Akamai redirects and fail-over pages in place for edge cases so that we could serve a graceful experience to visitors trying to access
            the content from outside the designated geographical regions.

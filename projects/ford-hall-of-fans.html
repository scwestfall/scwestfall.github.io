            The Ford Hall of Fans was created in partnership with the <a href="https://www.profootballhof.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Pro 
            Football Hall of Fame.</a> The <a href="https://nfl.com" target="_blank" class="link">National Football League (NFL)</a> is wildly 
            popular and there are team Super Fans throughout the league. Ford Motor Company and the Pro Football Hall of Fame decided to honor 
            these dedicated fans not only with a brand new Ford F-150, but also with  a visit from an NFL hall-of-famer, their own enshrinement ceremony 
            and permanent spot in the Hall!

            The sweepstakes was open nationwide for fan submissions from the weekend of the Hall of Fame Game through roughly three 
            quarters of the season. Once closed, submissions were carefully reviewed by a committee resulting in the selection of the 
            final six contestants. The final six were then added to the website and we opened a voting period where visitors could vote 
            for their favorite fan once per day during the duration of the contest. 
          </p>
          <p class="about__desc">
            This website was built using PHP on the Laravel framework with a MySQL database for storing submissions and voting results. Although 
            I don't have any screenshots, we also developed a private sweepstakes administration interface where the committee could login 
            to review submissions and vote counts in real-time.

            This amazing program for football fans ran for four good years, but was unfortunately discontinued after the 2022 
            enshrinement ceremony. The following fans now have their own special place within the hallowed halls of the Pro 
            Football Hall of Fame alongside NFL legends past and present. If you have a chance, stop by the Hall in Canton, Ohio and 
            check out the display.
